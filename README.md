# Signatures of Balancing Selection 
This repository holds all data and plotting scripts needed to reproduce plots from the paper "Erythrocytic surface and exported Plasmodium falciparum antigens dominate common signatures of balancing selection in populations across malaria endemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa", by M.F DIOP et. al. This includes plots in the main text and in the supporting material. In cases where the plotting data and scripts are located elsewhere, the relevant links are contained within the figure folder.
